There must be support for businesses occupying store fronts downtown. Development and maintenance of the Central Park area and seasonal decoration of business district throughout the year helps. The College shows an obvious commitment towards integration, at least physically, in the town, which helps both the town and the College. I’ve always thought that Iowans generally tend to find validation when chain restaurants and businesses take up occupancy in their communities. I think that Grinnell may have resisted that trend, or maybe Grinnell is too small for much of that to happen here, but the lack of a typical American strip of such businesses is an asset in my opinion.",We stayed because places we were interested in moving to were too expensive to afford the kind of house we were looking for. The lack of serious water supply and fire issues were other factors.,,It is difficult living in a factory. Grinnell is not big enough to avoid the continual reminder of the degradation of the environment by the dominant agricultural industry. That people accept that and even talk about how the “farmers” are working hard to provide our food is disturbing,"The lack of an ethnically diverse community, and along with that ethnically diverse dining options.

The relative paucity of local produce and meat at the grocery stores. I think that some city resources should be put towards supporting local food producers who struggle because most folks in Grinnell can’t or won’t afford to pay the prices that allow such farmers to make a living wage. I was surprised to read in the Herald Register that Grinnell actually owns 5 farms in the surrounding area that are managed by someone hired by the town - if memory serves - to support local folks who are food insecure. I wondered about how much of the production of those farms is actually human food rather than ethanol or diesel fuel or high fructose corn syrup.(It would frustrate me to find out that the management of those farms was not being done sustainably). It seems like a great opportunity for the town to support five young farm families who could work toward providing people in the town of Grinnell with  human food locally grown on small parcels of those farms.

I do a lot of walking throughout the year and I appreciate that the majority of Grinnell streets seem to have sidewalks, notably in the older parts of town, but the lack of sidewalks particularly on streets leading to some of the very nice parks in town is a real frustration, and more than that, a threat to my safety and a deterrence to other Grinnellians to get out. I can generate resentment when I’m tromping through slush in the street about the fact that I am expected to clear ice and snow from the sidewalk in front of my home, because I happen to live in a place where there is a sidewalk, while folks who have no sidewalk also have no community responsibility to maintain a passable track in front of their house. How is that fair? And while I’m at it, I find it annoying that I’m expected to keep my lawn mowed to less than 8 inches, and the City will charge me for mowing if I neglect to, but I’ve seen little effort by the City to similarly enforce a policy about maintaining a passable sidewalk - there are lots of places where shrubbery and trees present obstacles to safe passage on our sidewalks.
","Greater ethnic and cultural diversity.

Strong support for locally produced food and food processing - a community center with staff and commercially certified facilities where food growers (farmers and gardeners) could “put up” (freeze, can, etc) food in times of plenty. I’ve seen such places in rural NY.
","I’d start with my ideas above re: food. Support local growers - subsidize their food production and create facilities for food processing.
 
Then move on the sidewalk issue. First build the sidewalks in places where there are none. Since the folks that are unaccustomed to shoveling sidewalks will resent their new responsibility I think the City should purchase a fleet of electric-powered snow removal machines and hire the staff to clear all the walks in town. That might encourage more folks to get out.

Let’s start small, the “art installation” at the corner of hwy 6 and hwy 146 looks like baby gates or lattice around a porch.

We really miss that and wish there were more things like that.  ",,,job proximity and being connected to friends here.  we don't like to have to commute so grinnell is easy to live in because of that,,"Some of the shifts in the public schools towards being fearful of liberal arts education or the college I find hugely problematic and rooted in some type of fear and displacement of trust. 
 There's some longterm issues at play here, but it's very problematic. There seems to be a resurgence in xenophobic mindsets and a fear of education in general that I find deeply concerning.  Parents thinking that teaching about racism is wrong when it is a huge problem in the district.  During 2020 and 2021, the school board race became so ugly and heated, it was really discouraging to see how that played out.  What I'm finding is that some of our most wonderful families are leaving Grinnell either because they are ""too conservative"" or ""too liberal"" and that just makes me really sad.  Many families I know personally do not feel safe in this town because of how that played out, and I frankly do not blame them.

The downward trend in high quality business and restaurants in the last 5 years has been sad to witness and makes hard to ""stay"" in Grinnell for much of anything.  I don't have any great solutions, but it seems like we need a renewed focus on this from both the chamber of commerce and community members.  

The biggest reason we've considered leaving really is related to the school system.  All of our schools need MAJOR updates and it's a problem that needs a solution.  It's sad that every time a bond has come up, it hasn't past.  To me, there is just such a lack of pride in maintaining and furthering the pillars of our school system in the form of our buildings.  We need to invest so much more into our schools.

","I know as a small business owner myself the struggle many owners face to have a profitable business in this town, and I think what is frustrating is that people seem very willing to complain about the lack-of-variety in this town, but then want franchise restaurants or chains, and won't support local small businesses or spend the money locally to do so.  

I see other small college towns (I'm thinking of Pella) that have a HUGE sense of community pride and purpose, people have things to DO in their own town, and it seems like everyone wants to do their best to be the best.  I'd love to see the same sense of town vibrancy in Grinnell. ","I think it would be great to see more community-wide events.  They are a lot of work, but also a lot of fun for everyone.

I would LOVE to see more beautiful gardens and natural spaces!

We really need more businesses and restaurants that can appeal to a more eclectic tastes.  Less pro-typical small-town-iowa (sorry, I love it, but we have enough!) and more variety!  If you talk to anyone under 30 who did not grow up in Grinnell, you'll hear again and again how there's no good place to go out to eat or nothing to do - get more insight from this crowd, because they are the ones with disposable income that will keep this town alive!  It would be lovely to have an Indian restaurant in town.  I'd love to see a true art gallery or something of the sort.  No more consignment and rummage/thrift shops please.","the vaccant lot next to the movie theater i would make into a tapas restaurant with live music and indoor-outdoor vibes.  I would love to see QUALITY live music there and delicious food, wine.  A small little stage.  That would be so cool! 

Even though I love the neighborhood schools and how it makes things walkable for a lot of kids, we really do need a unified school for the K-5 age group.  That would 100% be the top of my list.  It would be better for the teachers, for the district, and get us into the 21st century for tech, utilities, space, disability accommodations, and so much more.  It would be HUGE for our town to have ONE new K-5 school.  We honestly need a better middle school too.  It's just awful.",n/a,"I own a small business, and our family has lived in Grinnell for 14 years.","I know people are afraid to talk about experiences of racism for feel people won't believe them or will dismiss their experience as no big deal.

","As a person who started a small business in this town nearly 13 years ago, there was very very little support for new entrepreneurs when I first started.  Very little support for women.  And definitely little support for anyone who didn't already know everybody or hadn't been around for awhile.

Having community businesses sponser an evening in the park? Theisens could teach you how to plant a pot…pay a fee and make a hanging basket. Pals, pay a fee and come snuggle adoptees and learn about how to properly groom your dog, high school robotics team could host a night and you can come learn how to code a robot to move through an obstacle course?

At Ahrens, it’s too hilly for a wheel chair but at least one or the other walking paths in town should be handicap accessible, and since Arbor lake already halfway is, someone might as will make the rest handicap accessible and leave the hills at Ahrens Park for the people that want to walk them. Makes sense to me. I’d also put a splash pad at Ahrens Park, I’d paint inspirational quotes all over the bathroom doors in all the schools. I’d paint the school bathrooms because they are all depressing and look institutionalized, I’d have awesome tiger graphics painted on the walls in the hallways, really make our schools looks awesome so that when other schools came for activities they’re like wow!

While the college puts expensive copper on buildings and professors' families go globe trotting during all their breaks, our local school kids wonder why we have moldy, broken-down school buildings and other communities provide more support. Frequent college employee turnover at the college (partly due to financially dead end staff salaries) increase home selling prices for everyone else and means that many amazing people to come to work here end up leaving before setting down roots and contributing to community improvement. Many college professors and upper management demonize and look down local people as less than them and don't respect local expertise and experience, which is part of why local people are uncomfortable on campus. College says they care about ""social justice"" and decreasing inequities, but doesn't really understand or care about rural people and their needs even though rural communities are struggling with less resources due to dysfunctional policies and systems.

Money, or appearance of money, begets money into the system. So nice roadways into Grinnell and on the major roads (at least), home improvement grants. Get rid of blighted houses and businesses that look like Grinnell is run down (former KFC building, for example). More coordinated town events that are well advertised across Iowa (""Hey, we do cool things in Grinnell""). To that end, have a vibrant social media campaign keeping everyone up to date on what is going on.  Celebrate the importance of our diversity as a town.

Intolerance isn't always on full display but it is there and it creates a dark undertow that influences decision making and resources, and it scares off many individuals who want to stay and could make a big difference. We bring amazing people in with the College but it is the town that scares them away.","I know it isn't something that you likely have any control over, but it would be great to have train service to Iowa City and DSM. Perhaps this part should have been addressed in the ""if money was no object"" section because it is very unlikely due to money constraints. I think if there was a quick, accessible train ride to either Iowa City or DSM we would draw many more people to the rural way of living as long as they would get to other resources quickly or could live rurally and work in an urban setting.

",I always feel connected during the holiday season--and when it's kicked off with the Jingle Bell Holiday and so many groups and shops and organizations show up.

The support local mentality at that time -- that then shows up in other times of celebration such as holiday season or crisis is pretty incredible.,,"I think like many places, the values are split based on individuals and how they show up and what they choose to value.

1/11/23 11:18,245,"My reconnection to the past and renewal of old friendships, my membership in St. Paul's Episcopal Church, the reputation of Grinnell College and the friendliness of the people.  We are close to a family farmstead we own in Hardin County that was homesteaded by my great-grandfather in 1892 and which we got back by chance at an auction in 2010.  We are restoring a remnant prairie there.","Our church (St. Paul's Episcopal), the friendships of like-minded people within that congregation and throughout the city, as well as the genuine welcome we received when we moved back to town after 58 years of being other places. ","Every day when I walk downtown in the early morning, remembering the businesses that used to be there and exploring those that have replaced them, and greeting friendly people going about their day.",,"I still believe that Grinnell, as a whole community, has a core value toward education, which includes the college and the public school system.  When I was growing up here in the 1950s, Grinnell was highly regarded within Iowa for its school system, and I think it still is.","I have NOT considered moving from Grinnell, nor would I ever do so.  This is home.  I am nearly 81 years old and this is where I plan to stay.",,"No, see the previous answer.  If I was not so committed to Grinnell, I would give you a long list of things we need to do better, which I will do anyway!  It begins by CLEANING UP THE SOUTH ENTRANCE (WEST SIDE) TO GRINNELL,  BEGINNING WITH THE WRECKER SERVICE/U-HAUL MESS ON THE EAST SIDE OF 146.  IT LOOKS LIKE RURAL ARKANSAS","The same applies to the trashy houses and yards on West Street, just north of 6th Ave. on the west side.  You could do that by enforcing the building codes and giving the homeowner a deadline to clean it up or vacate.  Drive into Pella from any direction and see the pride they have in how their city looks.  Grinnell does NOT have that level of commitment.  ""An ounce of Image is worth a pound of performance"".  Think about that.  Also, FIX THE STREETS!  4th from 146 to the hospital; Park Street from 10th to the golf course;  Country Club Drive and Manor Drive, Broad Street and Main Street from 11th down to 6th: Summer street and most others.  Who wants to move to a town with high property taxes and streets in need of repair? ","It is missing tax incentives to attract REAL businesses, not just fast food and minimum wage places.  Who has replaced Miracle Equipment, DeLong, GTE and others?  Nobody.  I think the Chamber needs to create a real marketing program to recruit and attract these kinds of businesses.  The city has depended for too long on Grinnell College and Grinnell Mutual to maintain a status quo, rather than create a better tax base.  Also, re-evaluate the building codes and inspection precesses to make it easier to say ""yes"" to entrepreneurs, rather than nickel and dime small businesses trying to start up (like Maria's) with petty regulations and power plays that cost money and loyalty (like you did to Maria's).  That is racist and unacceptable.  ","It is not so much unlimited funds as it is limited will and limited vision, plus a lack of political courage.  Remove the impediments to dismantling the scaffolding on the west side of Broad Street between 4th and 5th.  That has been up since before we moved back and there is no need to continue this litigation to languish.  Step up, solve it and move on.  It is a blight on the entire downtown, and it makes Grinnell look trashy","I live here, so I have a vested interest in the improvements I have just stated.   The sign on I-80 says ""Grinnell has 30+ restaurants"", but that's not true.  Give a tax incentive to someone to re-open the Depot and upgrade the kitchen, so that it is functional, safe and profitable.  That would be a real restaurant.  Don't depend on realtors to get that moving - form a partnership with the Chamber, recruit Des Moines chefs (or Iowa City or out of state), but be proactive.  Closed business that languish in a community fester and make us embarrassed to see that,  Political Courage - the ultimate oxymoron.","My family moved to Grinnell in 1954 with GTE and I graduated from GHS with the class of 1960.  It was a very formative time in my life and as a teenager I worked at Logsdon Shell station, Matthews Drug, Cunningham Drug, Iowa Cleaners and Smith Funeral Home, so I got to know a lot of people.  I always considered it my hometown.  I was encouraged to take the survey by friends at St. Paul's. Episcopal Church, where we have been members since our return to Grinnell in 2020.","The Future!  Addressing and creating a legacy for children to think positively about their home town after they have grown up.  Creating a place where they will want to stay and raise their families.  And last but certainly not least, creating an environment where racism will not be tolerated;","You don't ask for how we want to receive individual feedback from this survey, nor do you ask if we want to be on a committee or focus group or other involvement to fix these things that we have listed.  Do not dismiss the views of old people - they contain wisdom, experience and a real commitment to the community.  Commit back to us - it is an investment in the future of Grinnell.

The college no longer requiring their faculty to live in Grinnell.  When they live elsewhere and commute to work here, their children are no longer in our school district (which they enriched socially and via numbers), the families are elsewhere, so they are not supporting our local businesses ( which affects our local economy - both in keeping viable and in the variety of businesses that are available),  they are not mingling with local residents which widens the gap between town and gown and eliminates a common interest in the community.  Moving a dormitory downtown does not correct those problems.
","Car license station in Grinnell - it makes no  sense to have it in Montezuma when the population is centered  in  Grinnell --  Plus  the population of Mayflower and Seeland Park,  often don't even know where Montezuma is!  We have a large elder population and many drive only locally.  There is a space for it at our city offices and it should be here.

The Depot Restaurant is greatly missed !

A local ambulance service that would  also be used by Unity Point.  It is ludicrous to have a UP ambulance be summoned from Marshalltown to transport  patients from Unity Point Hospital in Grinnell...to one of the local nursing homes (coming 35 miles to transport a patient maybe 2 miles...and then return to Marshalltown, 35 miles.)  It's unconscionable to waste the gas, pollute the environment, and inconvenience patients.  

Real recycling program.  Other towns our size continue to do so...why don't we??  ""Saving money"" is important...but so is being a responsible community and saving our environment.  Bring in an industry that recycles materials. into something new.   Have curbside recycling pickup.  A lot of our senior citizens want to recycle but have no way nor  physical ability to take their recycles to the depository on 1st avenue.

We need  to make all citizens feel they are a part of our community and able to do something FOR our community.  Active, involved citizens are happy people and the community benefits.

We could take pride in welcoming them, helping assimilate them better, sharing our culture and values via ladies'  coffee time groups,  regular groups at Drake Library,  school parent groups, mental health conversational groups, etc.  A Bob Ray Iowa community.

Actually our community does not now have the Home Health, Mental Health, Meals on Wheels, Diamond Life residential care, nor Hospice  services it had 20 years ago.  (A great deal of that can be blamed on the reduced funding from our county in those areas and mostly from the State funding reductions.  Privatization of services has introduced an added level of regulations, ignorance,  poor services,  and expense.)  Our local citizens who run for office often proudly boast that if elected they will reduce  taxes !  Unfortunately money is needed to fund programs for these areas,  public schools, and hospitals. We get what we pay for.  Nothing much is said about those things.  Perhaps more emphasis could be put on insisting our citizens become more knowlegeable about problems  in our community instead of ignoring them.  This could be improved  via our newspapers, community programs, KGRN  having local and state information programming, Grinnell Ministerial Association.  Our city council should address community issues at every meeting.   I'm sure someone from our local agencies could  speak at every council meeting just to educate our council members...and those watching on line.

1/17/23 18:17,275,"  I love that the Fine Arts are set as a priority. The Arts Council specifically has done a great job with community involvement in terms of plays, kid opportunities, art showcases, and more. 
    I also am so glad to live in Grinnell in the summertime. The community of Grinnell in the summer is so strong and enjoyable to be around. Music in the Park, Farmers Market, Summerfest (which unfortunately hasn’t been going on since before covid), and outdoor restaurant seating areas are just a few of my favorite aspects about Grinnell in the summer. 
   Friendliness is also very prominent in this town. Local grocery stores, such as McNallys, restaurants, such as Jays Deli and Prairie Canary, and shops, such as Saints Rest or Anna Kaytes, always have a welcoming presence. ","The nostalgia of Grinnell as my hometown is always present. I travel fairly often, but I am always excited by the end of my trip to come back to Grinnell. This town continues traditions that have been going on for years that always bring back childhood memories for me, such as Art Camp, the Too Many String Band at Saints Rest, and Jingle Bell Holiday, to name a few.","In 2016, I was asked to be in the film called “Saints Rest” directed by Noga Ashkenazi, a former Grinnell College alumni. The film highlighted all of the aspects about Grinnell life that I adore. Music, community, friendliness, activities, and quaintness are all major elements positively described to be associated with Grinnell. I was an extra in the Community Choir (a choir just for the film) and it made me feel so proud to be representing Grinnell in such a wonderful way.",,"I think Grinnell as a community represents friendliness. Many people here smile at strangers on the street, engage in conversation with friends of a friend of a friend, and even help out random community members out of sheer kindness. ","I have never considered moving away from Grinnell, even for college. Next year, I plan to begin my first college years at Grinnell College, mainly because this town is where I wish to continue living. My entire family lives here, I feel at home, this town continues to keep the traditions alive, and I love the small-town friendly feeling when I walk downtown.",,"Although I haven’t seriously considered leaving Grinnell, there have been some things that I wish could be different. For example, there are not as many opportunities or options here as there are in other, oftentimes bigger, towns. There aren’t any fancy restaurants, picturesque flower or nature areas, or hangout places besides bars/restaurants.","   There is not much of a cuisine variety in Grinnell. The restaurants downtown all have fairly similar menus, besides 2 Mexican restaurants and 1 Chinese restaurant, which is takeout only. 
   When I hangout with my friends, there are very few options to do/go to. Hotel Grinnell is the only real game place where we can hangout at, but even then, that’s not really its intended purpose. At one point, there was a roller skating rink with games, but it wasn’t very well set up and it went away within a year. 
   Rock Creek would be an awesome hangout spot for friends in the summer, but the water toxic and is not safe to swim in and the beach is tiny and dirty. I’m not sure if this would be a problem that this project would deal with, but it is something that I think needs improvement.
   The Grinnell College Golf Course pool use to be my favorite place to go with my family and friends in the summer. Even though there is a City Waterpark/Pool, it is incredibly different compared to the vibe at the Golf Course pool. I like the quaintness and simplicity of the Golf Course pool and it is the perfect place to enjoy a sunbathing and relaxing day with some friends. Many people in the community I have talked with would be strong advocates in the return of the Gold Course pool. ","-More restaurants (a nice restaurant and more diverse cuisine (ex: açaí, gelato, geographic/cultural cuisines, etc)

In addition the college is building a big monstrosity of a building which the college and the city say is going to bring people together.  I doubt that will be the case.  Instead these places are going to exacerbate the existing parking problems.  Right now there is a huge problem for St. Mary's church parking due to cutting off the parking on Broad street.  The city is now subsidizing apartments on 4th Ave in downtown area.  Have you tried to find a place to park on that block lately?  Where are all these people going to park?
My other huge frustration is the fact that the city and the school board bought property and keep passing it back and forth.  And now the city is subsidizing a rich builder from Des Moines to build houses and apartments on 11th ave.  This whole thing reeks of graft and cronyism.  ",,,

It's hard to articulate what I see.  

My perspective comes from my own experience. I was a Malcom/Brooklyn townie until 1970 and a farmer after that.  To ""US"", Grinnell people were a step above in every way imaginable.  ""WE"" wore blinders due to our inexperience and insecurities.  It was only in my adulthood after traveling to Europe, South America and Africa that I realized that my blinders had come off.  I no longer felt ""less than"" ""just a visitor"" ""hopeful that I wouldn't screw up"" when I was in  Grinnell.

Here's a concrete example.  The Grinnell Herald Register is an amazing publication.  We love getting it twice a week.  My husband -- the real farmer in the family -- reads it front to back. (I scan the photos and ask him what's going on around town.)  Our peers don't subscribe because they don't believe the ""Grinnell news"" has anything to do with them.

There's no one to blame.  It's just the blinders that are part of the small town/rural culture.

It would also be nice to establish a green buffer around the entire circumference of the town. I believe that was proposed years ago, but with no success. In other words, a large park that encompasses the entire town, with areas that would provide habitat for more wildlife, walking and bike paths, play areas, picnic areas, etc. Some sort of safer bike connections between the existing parks would be wonderful. It's really great that there is now a bike path all the way to Rock Creek State Park, and also one that goes under Hwy Six and by the water park.
","See above. Also, in dreaming really big, it would be amazing to turn at least part of the downtown into a version of an old English arcade - with an ironwork and glass ceiling covering a street.
It would also be wonderful to have a local heating/cooling plant that operated by the burning of trash (with low emissions of pollutants) which could then be piped to homes and businesses.

Negative: Grinnell is in Iowa which, like many rural-heavy states, has swung sharply into reactionary, racist, sexist, homophobic politics. It's incredibly disheartening to live in a state whose ruling party prioritizes privatizing education, restricting women's access to healthcare, bullying queer and trans kids, restricting students' access to books, and punishing people for being poor.

","I would say my family and how everything is so close and convenient. When in a hurry, I can get to my grandmas house and all around town in a matter of minutes. The fact that everything in town is so convenient makes life so much easier in Grinnell. ",I feel particularly connected to the community during home basketball games at GHS. I am proud when I get to run out onto the floor and perform in front of a packed crowd that supports us. ,,"I think Grinnell has values support for certain activities. In town, when a specific event is occurring, especially around the college, lots of people gather and attend events. We have a high level of support in Grinnell that other communities don't.","I would say my family playes a huge role in where I live. My entire family and grandma lives here, so I wouldn't leave them, but I would also say there is such a strong community bond that would keep me here. It also is beautiful.",,"I would consider leaving Grinnell because of the lack of shops, eating options, and recreational activities.  ","Sometimes it can be frustrating because there aren't many things to go out and do in my free time. I tend to do the same activities over and over, especially in the summer. ",I would benefit from fun activities held around town like at central park or something. It would be cool if there was a weekly challenge or activity that get people involved.,"I would add more restaurants with variety, more shopping, and more groceries stores. There are lots of vacant restaurants and shops that are just sitting there. We should put them to use.",I would be more likely to move to Grinnell because of the homely feel and the connections between citizens. Everyone knows each other and everything is so convenient. ,Katelyn VanCompernolle,"People never talk about the community relationships. We all know each other, support each other, and get along, but nobody ever talks about that. They just act like its a given.","What should we do more of? We should offer more activities for kids. We do a couple things in Central Park, but something new and repeated every week would be fun. Something to keep the kids involved and connected. ",,,

Although we got some wild people through there the whole town was having fun together! ,,"I think that Grinnell might be able to work on that one a little bit, we definitely value the college and schooling side of the town but the steets with torn down houses right next to one’s with crown moldings makes our town look a little messy. ","The schools, you get an amazing education with all of the great teachers. ",,"The cost of living is pretty high, that’s about it! ","How little we care about our parks! We just built a beautiful new playground in central park and during the day so many kids have fun but during the night when it’s still open to anyone there are kind of trashy people, who litter or partake in illegal activities.
